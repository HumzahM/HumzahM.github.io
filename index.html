    <h1>Hi, my name is Humzah Merchant.</h1>

            I've actually lost a lot of weight since this photo was taken.
            My hair is also shorter and I'm clean shaven. </figcaption>

    <p>I am a junior at UChicago, studying statistics and computer science. I'm currently working on research with Dr. Bradford Levy at Booth related to LLMs and Finance.
    Last summer I worked at Apollo Global Management as an engineer. Last year I did research with Dr. Larry Harris at USC Marshall. I spent Summers 2023 2022 at NASA JSC in Houston.
    I really enjoy doing research which is a mix of statistics, computer science, and finance because in there you find things that are intuitive enough that you
    could explain it to someone with no technical background while also being incredibly interesting and potentially groundbreaking.
    If I'm not working I'm probably with friends or watching TV. Sometimes I'll make them watch TV with me. I think that often annoys them.</p>
    <h2>I have three projects which I think are the most important parts of my resume:</h2>
        <h3>1. LLMs in Finance Research (Oct 2024 - Present)</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="booth.png" style="width:25%">
            </figure>
            <p>Out of respect for Dr. Levy I won't share too much of the details of the current project online. Its related to LLMs and finance
                and incredibly interesting. </p>
            </p>
        <h3>2. My summer project at Apollo</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="apollo.png" style="width:25%">
                <figcaption>Unfortunately I can't find a screenshot of what I did on any of my personal devices</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I spent most of the summer working on one large scale webapp. It was my first and hopefully last time doing fullstack outside of class.
                It was a website for one of the client teams to manage some large and complex email lists, including a maker-checker workflow and audit trail. </p>
            <p> <u>What I learned over the summer: How to navigate the bureaucracy of a large corporation to get things done. How to take a project from nothing to production. 
                    What its like to sit in an incident review meeting after you broke production on a Thursday afternoon.</u>
            </p>
        <h3>3. Markets in "Event Time" Research (Oct 2023 to March 2024)</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="event_time1.jpg" style="width:35%">
                <img src="event_time2.jpg" style="width:35%">
                <figcaption>Some of the dozens of figures I made</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I worked on a project studying the markets in "event time". Right now we think about markets in calendar time - Today and Tomorrow, January and February, etc.
                The project asked what if we looked at it in terms of market activity? How do we split 30 years (360 calendar months) into 360 periods of equal event time?
                I had to build a model to figure out what that means to setup the market in terms of market activity. I ended up doing a front and back rolling average
                of number of trades, which was challenging since the number of trades has exponentially increased over time. 
                The results were generally interesting but unfortunately not groundbreaking enough to be worth publishing.
            </p>
            <p> <u>What I learned: Python, Pandas, and big data related work. That I really enjoy research. That messy code leads to
                bad results and confusion and on my next project I need to have more discipline from day 1.
            </u>
            </p>
    <h2>Other:</h2>
    <h3>I don't really like having a public portfolio and Linkedin and I hope one day I'll be at a point where I can quietly take everything offline.</h3>
    <p>We have a culture of people's status being based on their material accomplishments, such as school and internship names. 
        Even worse people get into the nuances of that - discussing the rank by major or front office vs back office. Never a good thing when those topics come up. 
        I got my first "internship" at NASA through a program called Summer Robotics Academy (SRA) where any NASA sponsored FIRST robotics team could send a handful of graduating seniors to the Johnson Space Center. 
    There wasn't an interview or application. Our team was NASA sponsored because one of the alumni's mom's worked at JPL and spent an hour a month on Zoom with the team so so we could maintain our status.
    A few months into freshman year I emailed NASA and asked if I could return and they were kind enough to say yes.
    Both times I was lucky enough to have parents who were able to support me unpaid in another city halfway across the US. I know that is not an option for everyone.
    A lot of opportunities have come since then. I'm proud to say I work on hard (on things that interest me at least) but I know a lot of people who work just as hard who haven't got their lucky break yet.</p>
    <p><b>If you are beating yourself up about not having the internship or opportunities that you want yet:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>If you meet someone who has killer high school or freshman (or even sophomore) internships, 9/10 chance they got it through a niche program like I did it or through some kind of nepotism. Don't compare yourself</li>
        <li>For every person in this world who has a $50/hr internship at 20 or 21, there are multiple people with lesser paying or unpaid internships. For each of them there are several working minimmum wage and several around the world who don't know where their next meal will come from.
            <i>"Whoever among you wakes up physically healthy, feeling safe and secure within himself, with food for the day, it is as if he acquired the whole world."</i>
        </li>
        <li>Ask yourself if you actually like what you are doing or just the career prospects and you don't have any better ideas. 
            This one mostly goes for you CS majors and premeds</li>
