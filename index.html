    <h1>Hi, my name is Humzah Merchant.</h1>

    <p>I am a junior at UChicago, studying statistics and computer science. I'm currently working on research with Dr. Bradford Levy at Booth related to LLMs and Finance.
    Last summer I worked at Apollo Global Management as an engineer. Last year I did research with Dr. Larry Harris at USC Marshall. I spent Summers 2023 2022 at NASA JSC in Houston.
    I really enjoy doing research which is a mix of statistics, computer science, and finance because in there you find things that are intuitive enough that you
    could explain it to someone with no technical background while also being incredibly interesting and potentially groundbreaking.
    If I'm not working I'm probably with friends or watching TV. Sometimes I'll make them watch TV with me. I think that often annoys them.</p>
    <h2>My Experiences:</h2>
        <h3>LLMs in Finance Research (Oct 2024 - Present)</h3>

            <p>Out of respect for Dr. Levy I won't share too much of the details of the current project online. Its related to LLMs and finance
                and incredibly interesting. </p>
            </p>
        <h3>Apollo - SWE Intern (May 2024 - Aug 2024)</h3>

            </figure>
            <p>I spent most of the summer working on one large scale webapp. It was my first and hopefully last time doing fullstack outside of class.
                It was a website for one of the client teams to manage some large and complex email lists, including a maker-checker workflow and audit trail. </p>
            <p> <u>What I learned over the summer: How to navigate the bureaucracy of a large corporation to get things done. How to take a project from nothing to production. 
                    What its like to sit in an incident review meeting after you broke production on a Thursday afternoon.</u>

        <h3>Markets in "Event Time" Research (Oct 2023 to Ma 2024)</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="event_time1.jpg" style="width:35%">
                <img src="event_time2.jpg" style="width:35%">
                <figcaption>Some of the dozens of figures I made</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I worked on a project studying the markets in "event time". Right now we think about markets in calendar time - Today and Tomorrow, January and February, etc.
                The project asked what if we looked at it in terms of market activity? How do we split 30 years (360 calendar months) into 360 periods of equal event time?
                I had to build a model to figure out what that means to setup the market in terms of market activity. I ended up doing a front and back rolling average
                of number of trades, which was challenging since the number of trades has exponentially increased over time. 
                The results were generally interesting but unfortunately not groundbreaking enough to be worth publishing.
            </p>
            <p> <u>What I learned: Python, Pandas, and big data related work. That I really enjoy research. That messy code leads to
                bad results and confusion and on my next project I need to have more discipline from day 1.
            </u>

            <p>I spent two summers at NASA Johnson Space Center through a program called the Summer Robotics Academy,
                for graduating seniors on FIRST Robotics Teams. After my first summer I asked to return and they kindly
                said yes. 
            </p>
    <h3>Other: I don't really like having a public portfolio and Linkedin and I hope one day I'll be at a point where I can quietly take everything offline.</h3>
    <p>I don't want anyone to ever feel bad after looking at my page or feel as if they aren't doing enough. 
        This page exists because I wanted to higlight some of my work in more space then a one pager.
        I know a lot of people are struggling right now to land any summer internship in this market. 
        Good luck and reach out to me if I can help you out!
